          Bread and Tulips is a film about a woman named Rosalba and her journey to find herself. It starts with her being stranded at a rest stop during a family vacation. 
          Instead of waiting, she decides to visit Venezia because she has always wanted to go there but never got the chance. While there, she finds her independence and love. 
          She does return home because she hears her son has taken to drugs. After being home, her lover from Venezia comes and convinces her to return to happiness instead back 
          in Venice and ends with the dance scene, as shown, symbolizing her choice of happiness and love over everything else. There is no dance shown in but rather shows the 
          happiness everyone feels after love has won.

          <h3>Historical Context</h3>
          Italy's second republic started in 1992 and goes up until today. Much of the changes had to do with the people changing and the ideas. People were done with 
          the corruptions of the last system and were hoping for a system that was more in line with their ideas. Many of the parties were dissolved and new ones were created. 
          Women were also becoming more independent. This film had many elements of that and showed with Rosalba how she was able to live by herself, get a job, and live independently from 
          her husband with little issue.

        Preferisco il rumore del mare (I Prefer the Sound of the Sea) is a film about a boy from the South, Rosario, who moves to the North due to a man who takes pity on the fact he is an orphan. 
        The business man from the North, Luigi, was originally from the South and wants to help Rosario become successful because he thinks that is the only way to become successful. Rosario forms 
        an unlikely friendship with his son, Matteo and learns to tolerate the life in the North. However, in the North, Rosario finds many differences from his life in the South mostly having to deal 
        with stereotypes. In the end, Rosario decides he wants a life he is comfortable with. He “prefers the sound of the sea” and his life in the South without judgement.

        <h3>Punk Dancing</h3>
        One scene in the film focuses on giving some background to Matteo and showing his rebellion through the music he listens to which is punk music. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, 
        Punk music and danced seemed to infiltrate Europe and Italy in a very impactful way. Punk dancing is hard to categorize. Punk music has a long history of captivating youth who feel 
        lost in the world, very much so how Matteo feel. It is usually just a person “moshing” and often happens in a group. Often these moshes involve people who jump up and down and ram their 
        shoulders into each other. This is seen in this film seen in the above video clip with Matteo as he is dancing around his room and finishes his dance by ramming into his door.

          Loose Cannons is a film about a well off family who finds out one of their sons is homosexual. In reality, both sons are homosexual, but after the news about the oldest, 
          the father has a stroke thus forcing the younger son, Tommaso, to keep hiding it. He wishes to be a writer but is thrust into the family pasta business instead due to the 
          actions of his brother. Overall, this comedy aims to shed light on how ridiculous the family is but also comment on homosexuality in Italy. There is no particular dance 
          in this film, but the scene shown here shows how dancing beings family together and can span decades (the scene seems to start at the grandmothers wedding and moves into her funeral). 
          It can make people happy even in the saddest of times. It can bring families together even in sadness.

          <h3>Historical Context</h3>
          In Italy, many homosexuals are still not accepted to this day. In 2016, homosexual civil unions were granted civil unions, but not marriage. It was stalled for years 
          before finally being accepted 173-71. Many people at the time were still not happy with this legistlation due to the fact that this “victory” was heavily conditioned. 
          (Winfield). With this in mind, one can see in the film how the father would react as he did. Homosexual individuals were just not accepted by many in Italy, and 
          currently same-sex marriage is not legalized.

        La Pazza Gioia (Like Crazy) is a film about two women, Beatrice and Donatella, who escape from a psychiatric facility. They become fast friends before their escape and 
        are often put with each other because they seem to be better with each other. Beatrice is a very loud and exuberant women while Donatella is quiet and brooding. During their 
        escape, they both realize they need help with their mental conditions. Donatella sees her son who she was declared unfit for and wishes to help her mental state not to hurt 
        him again. Beatrice, though very adamant that she is okay, decides it might be better for herself to get her mental state under control. Overall, both women find kinship in 
        each other and form an unexpected bond.

        <h3>Discoteca (Club)</h3>
        This film features a scene from a club that gives us a peak into the electronic dance scene of Italy that is currently captivating many. In the film, Donatella 
        used to work for this club before having her son with the club owner before going into her spiral of depression and loss. The punk scene of Italy seemed to flow 
        easily into an electronic club scene that many people enjoyed. The scene in Italy is not as big as London’s electronic scene. Italy, itself, has a very different 
        type of scene than most electronic scenes around the world. The Italian electronic scene started in the 1980s known as Italo Disco. This was due to its very unique 
        style common only in Italy during this time. One can tell this still has some influence on the times. In the scene from the film, this shows the 70s/80s style seen in 
        modern clubs and how much they are still influenced by this.
