          <h3>Rock-and-Roll</h3>
          During the 50s, the entire world became enchanted by Rock and Roll. Often this style of dance mostly had to do with the music but often included the dance style as well (like the Jitterbug) (Watson). 
          Italy was no exception to this mentality. Though these dances were often deemed controversial because of the swinging hips, youth loved it and could not get enough.
          Elvis seemed to have huge influence on the world not just America. After the war, many Italian singers were influenced by the greats of America and Italy was craving influence of new music. 
          Many famous Rock and Roll stars even emerged from Italy or had Italian roots (Bensalhia). For example, Adriano Celentano was considered the Elvis of Italy. 
          He did not merely copy the culture of the US but in a way created his own type of music specific to Italy ().

          <em>Il Sorpasso</em> is an interesting film that follows the antics of two men as they go on a two day journey together just for fun. 
          Bruno happens to come across a law student, Roberto, who was convinced The film itself is fairly light hearted 
          and is an example of exemplary Italian comedy. The point of the film is to try and live life to the fullest and take evey opportunity 
          as it comes even if it seems crazy. In just two days, Bruno gave Roberto the best two days of his life before his tragic passing.

          <h3>The Twist</h3>
          <em>The Twist</em> itself is a dance that many are very familiar with. It became a worldwide phenomenon in the 1960s and the reason is not quite known 
          why it became so big. The dance itself is based on Chubby Checker's song and dance that was featured on the Dick Clark Show in 1960. Due to the simplicity of the dance, 
          many people were able to pick up the dance. The scene above in the video shows this fairly well. People who lived on farmers got together and danced 
          the twist. They did not have a lot of money but they had each other and some time to relax and dance. Later in the film, a more "high class" party shows 
          them also doing the twist just emphasizing its popularity with everyone (Rosenberg 2017). In a way, the popularity of this style of dance 
          showed how much American had an influence on Italian culture.

        This film has many elements involved in it from the mafia to the way communism had swept through and took a strong hold of Italy. In this film, *****Italy itself was under 
        major cultural changes as well with the feminist and workers movements. This can be seen with various aspects of the film from the worker who died at
        Mimi's work and the various interactions with Fiorella. Of course this film had a very comical approach to what was happening.
        <h3>Tango</h3>
        This film shows a scene in which Mimi seduces Amalia with what seems to be the <em>Tango</em>. This dance style seems to have controversial questions as to 
        where it originated and how it has routes in Italy. While the <em>tango</em> has a huge basis in Argentina, it seems to have captivated Italians for years. 
        This could be due to the fact that many Italians had immigrated to Argentina in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Despite this film taking place in the 1970s 
        the fact that Italy was still entranced by it seems to show just how lasting of a dance type it is. To this day, it is still danced and appreciated by Italians.
        In Serra's paper he states "The sentimentality that flows from tango melody derives from the feeling of nostalgia and longing for broken families and distant homes." 
        This in itself is quite a beautiful statement and goes well with how this dance both captivates Mimi and Amalia and shows her longing for love.
