# Marianna's Italian Project
This site contains the materials to focus on Italian history through the eyes of film and dance. Many Italians love both dance and music and various films encompass that passion.

This was the final project made for course MLIT-351: Italian Cinema: 1945 to Present at Rochester Institute of Technology.
