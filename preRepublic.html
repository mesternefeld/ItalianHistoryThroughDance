          <em>The Leopard</em> itself is a film that takes place during the unification of Italy on the island of Sicily. This film is often 
          regarded as the director's greatest works. It follows Prince Fabrizio Salina and his family as the revolutions of Sicily are starting to 
          take hold. Much of the films goes through how politics often affect the actions and thoughts of political figures and bless marriages that
          will mutually benefit both parties. Overall, the film focuses on the historical context of Sicily as well as hints at its future with the rest 
          of Italy.

          <h3>Historical Context</h3>
          The Unification of Italy happened from the 1850s until the 1870s when various military and political events happened throughout Modern day Italy.  
          In the late 1940s, much of Italy wanted independence from the surrounding countries such as Austria, France, and Spain. 
          Much of Italy was extremely fragmented after the congress at Vienna in 1815. 
          Specifically, this film focuses on how Sicily becomes a part of Italian unification. Giuseppe Garibaldi was the main character in adding Sicily to the Kingdom of 
          Sardenia thus making it a part of Italy in 1861. The unification concluded with the additions of Venice and Rome.
          <hr />
          <h3>Ballroom/Waltz</h3>
          Ballroom is one of the most iconic dance styles out there. <em>Brunetta</em> states the scene in the Leopard is considered one of the most grandiose scenes in Italian film and cinema. 
          It immediately immerses the viewer into the time period with both costume and dance. The short clip above shows the ballroom scene at the end of the film in which Angelica 
          dances with the Prince. The ballroom style of dance itself is very elegant, grandiose, and immersive.
          It, itself, is considered one of the greatest of the social dance types. Thw waltz was considered scandalous in te 19th century before becoming widely accepted and 
          popular. It was a spirit of both excitement and embraced romance <em>(Powers)</em>.

          <h3>Historical Context</h3>
          This film was created in the midst of fascism and the resistence war of Italy. Many factors were going against the stronghold Mussolini had on current Italian society. The Allies, Communists, and Christian Democrats 
          all had an influence on Italy and hoped for the minimalization of fascist forces on the people. The peopel themselves were resisting the power favoring communism and frankly anything other 
          than what Mussolini provided (Ginsborg).

                <em>A Special Day</em> is a film that takes place in the middle of the fascist regime. This is a film of both 
                finding passion and looking at the normalcies around us and challenging ideas around us. The film follows 
                Antonietta and Gabriele on the day Hitler visits Italy in 1938. Both stay home for different reasons but 
                bond over their internal defiance for fascist beliefs. Gabirele challenges Antonietta's beliefs that all 
                she could do was be a housewife and in the end of the film, she decides she wants more than the fascist life 
                that is expected of her. Originally she had no problems with it, but quickly sees the life she can have by being 
                with Gabriele who himself was a defiance to fascism because of his sexuality. 
                <hr />
                <h3>Rumba</h3>
                The <em>Rumba</em> scene was in the film in the beginning where Gabriele and Antonietta meet in Gabriele's apartment.
                Gabriele has footsteps on the floor to help with the general motions of the dance. The Rumba itself is not native to 
                Italy. It is native to Cuba and is from the mid 19th century. The origins of the dance come from the people of Cuba wanting 
                to defy and protest the slavery in the country at the time according to <em>Ingber</em> from the Smithsonian. This in itself 
                is interesting because of the correlation to this piece of history to the film. Both groups wanted their freedom from the opression
                they were facing. <em>Lee, Rivera, & Won</em> stated in their school project that the <em>Rumba</em> was often paired with 
                sexuality and called in the US "the woman's dance." It seems interesting that of all the dances the director could have chosen, 
                this dance was an interesting choice due to its ties to both sexuality and freedom.

            While this film was technically during the First Republic, many aspects of this film relate to neorealistic themes 
            found typically during the era right before the republic.
            This film is an iconic piece of Neorealism and of how Italy itself was on the verge of a change. This film specifically 
            represents the change in both women and society itself.
            <em>Bitter Rice</em> is a film that takes place in Torino during the months were the women would work the rice fields 
            right after the war. The film shows the journey of Francesca 
            trying to hide herself from the law that is after her lover, Walter. Along the way she meets Silvana who becomes 
            captivated by Francesca's life of adventure before Walter seduces Silvana 
            and ropes her into his scheme to make more money.<hr />
            <h3>Boogie-Woogie</h3>
            In <em>Mass Culture and Italian Society from Fascism to the Cold War (2007)</em> by Forgacs and Gundle talks about how the <strong>boogie-woogie</strong> itself shook up old Italian customs.
            While partnering dances were always popular in Italy, there was nothing quite like the <strong>boogie-woogie</strong>, as seen by Silvana in the film and in the video to the left.
            This was because traditional dancing often was very structured and did not have as much hip shaking which was often considered scandelous. 
            In a way, <em>Bitter Rice</em> embodied this change and showed how women were becoming more independent from Italy's fascist past. This dance itself is iconic to this change and iconic for the
            film. Silvana in this scene embodies both the changes in women and even American influence in Italy. 
            
            The video shown here is Silvana doing her beloved <em>boogie-woogie</em> in the beginning of the film. In  Di Paola's article, the <em>boogie-woogie</em> itself is defined as a fast paced swing type dance. Its American counter is the <em>East Coast Swing</em>. The term <em>boogie-woogie</em> is commonly only used in Europe. 
            It is an extremely social, meaning it is often used in social gatherings and situations. It is commonly tied to rock-and-roll and was popular in the 1950s. The history behind it itself is quite obscure 
            as <em>boogie-woogie</em> music had been around for almost 50 years by that time but the dance itself came much later and was often getting paired with Rock-and-Roll style dancing.
